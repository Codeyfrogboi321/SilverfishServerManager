# SilverfishServerManager
A free Server Manager for minecraft to help manage self hosted servers

# HOW TO USE
Step 1) Find a server.jar file you want to use e.g. forge, paper, bukkit etc (This project was tested and is intended to be used with a papermc server)
Step 2) extract the file(SilverFishServerManager-r-<version>.zip), then with the server file downloaded, copy and paste it into the ServerFiles folder
Step 3) run the "run.bat" file and type 1 so it starts the server
Step 4) go into ServerFiles, and make sure a file named "plugins" exists

if anything doesnt work feel free to edit the code or contact me on discord at skyduck34
